title: Learner Profiles
---

This course is designed for microscopists in the life sciences who want to get started with microscopy image analysis using Python and Napari. It assumes learners already have:

- Basic familiarity with programming (e.g., using variables, loops, functions). If you need help, see our Python primer [here](https://igc-advanced-imaging-resource.github.io/image-analysis-python-napari/reference.html#python-syntax-primer).
- Some experience working with digital microscopy images, even if only through acquisition or basic visual inspection in software like FIJI. We have also prepared a primer of the basics of digital images [here](https://igc-advanced-imaging-resource.github.io/image-analysis-python-napari/reference.html#digital-images-primer) but if you want to put your best foot forward at the workshop then a great resource to prime yourself with is Pete Bankhead's online textbook ["Introduction to Bioimage Analysis"](https://bioimagebook.github.io/index.html), particularly the section on ["Images & Pixels"](https://bioimagebook.github.io/chapters/1-concepts/1-images_and_pixels/images_and_pixels.html)

No prior experience with Napari or advanced image processing techniques is required.
